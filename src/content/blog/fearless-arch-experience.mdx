_A simple guide to creating automatic system backups on Arch Linux._

<Image src={archLinux} alt="Arch Linux logo" />

One of the most notorious aspects of daily driving Arch Linux is the fear of breaking your system. The fear of losing all your configurations, themes, and scripts is a nightmare for any ricer. However, I am here to tell you that with the help of `rsync` and `timeshift`, or any other backup tool, you can easily create a backup of your system and restore it in case of a disaster. In fact, I recently had a system crash and was able to restore my system back to its previous state without any data loss. In this blog, I will guide you through the process of creating an automatic setup to backup your system using `timeshift`.

## Automatic System Backups Setup

### Step 1: Installation of `timeshift`

Install `timeshift` using the following command or using the pacman helper of your choice:

```bash
sudo pacman -S timeshift
```

To verify the installation, run the following command:

```bash
sudo timeshift --version
```

### Step 2: Periodic Backups

You can choose to use any GUI tool or the command line to create backups.

#### Using GUI Tools

If you use the timeshift GUI tool, you can easily configure the backup settings and configure the backup location and backup schedule.

### Step 3: Adding Pacman Hooks

To ensure that your system is backed up before any system upgrade, you can add a `pacman` hook. Create a new file in `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/backup.hook` and add the following script:

```hook
# https://man.archlinux.org/man/alpm-hooks.5

[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package
Target = *

[Action]
Description = pre-upgrade rsync backup
Depends = timeshift
When = PreTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c "/etc/pacman.d/hooks.bin/backup.sh"
AbortOnFail
```

Create a new file in `/etc/pacman.d/hooks.bin/backup.sh` and add the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Path to backup folder. Usually in the form of <path>/timeshift/snapshots-ondemand
find "path/to/backup" -mmin -10 | grep $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "timeshift backup canceled, time threshold not met"
else
    sudo /usr/bin/timeshift --create --comments "timeshift-pacman-hook-snapshot"
fi
exit

```

This script will create a backup before any system upgrade if a backup was not created in the last 10 minutes.

## System Recovery

In case of a system crash, you can easily restore your system using the backup created. To restore your system, boot into a live USB and mount the root partition to /mnt, boot partition to /mnt/boot, and the backup partition to a folder of your choice. Then run the following command:

Delete all files from /mnt/boot

```bash
rm -rf /mnt/boot/*
```

Restore the backup

```bash
# Use the path to the previous backup, usually in the form of <path>/timeshift/shnapshots/2022-09-15_18-00-01
path_to_previous_backup="/path/to/previous_backup"
rsync -avxPAX --exclude="lost+found" "$path_to_previous_backup/localhost/boot" /mnt/boot
```

Move the files into /mnt/boot

```bash
mv /mnt/boot/boot/* /mnt/boot
rm -rf /mnt/boot/boot
```

Great, you have successfully restored your system. Now reboot your system and you should be good to go.

During my recent Arch Linux install, the hardest part I encountered was dealing with WPA2-Enterprise WiFi. There wasn’t a consolidated step by step guide available on the internet and after having been through the struggle myself, I want to share how to properly setup WiFi on your Arch Linux install so you can start ricing as soon as possible.

### Phase 1: ISO Stage

1. Access `iwctl` Terminal
   Type `iwctl` in the terminal. Commands prefixed with `[iwd]#` are executed inside the `iwctl` interactive prompt. To exit, type `exit`.

2. List Wireless Devices

```bash
[iwd]# device list
```

1. Scan and List Networks
   Replace `<name>` with your device name (e.g., `wlan0`):

```bash
[iwd]# station <name> scan
[iwd]# station <name> get-networks
```

4. Connect to Network
   To connect to a network, use its `SSID`:

```bash
[iwd]# station <name> connect <ssid>
```

To disconnect:

```bash
[iwd]# station <name> disconnect
```

5. Configure WPA2-Enterprise Network
   Create and edit a network configuration file:

```bash
touch /var/lib/iwd/<ssid>.8021x
nano /var/lib/iwd/<ssid>.8021x
```

Add the following details in the editor:

```bash
[Security]
EAP-Method=PEAP
Identity=<username>
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=<username>
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=<password>
[Settings]
AutoConnect=true
```

6. Restart iwd Service

```bash
systemctl restart iwd
```

7. Reconnect to WPA2-Enterprise Network

```bash
iwctl
[iwd]# station <name> connect <ssid>
[iwd]# station <name> show
```

8. Enable NetworkManager Daemon

```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

  Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl)._

### Phase 2: Post-Arch Installation

After successfully installing the Linux firmware and rebooting into arch Linux, you might realize that you have lost your internet connection once again. So here we go again.

1. Check Network Devices

```bash
nmcli d
```

2. Add a New Connection
   Replace `<device>` with your device name, and `<connection_name>` with a name of your choice:

```bash
nmcli con add type wifi ifname <device> con-name <connection_name> ssid <ssid>
```

3. Configure and Connect
   Enter the nmcli interactive prompt:

```bash
nmcli con edit id <connection_name>
```

Set up the connection details:

```bash
[nmcli]# set ipv4.method auto
[nmcli]# set 802–1x.eap peap
[nmcli]# set 802–1x.phase2-auth mschapv2
[nmcli]# set 802–1x.identity <username>
[nmcli]# set 802–1x.password <password>
[nmcli]# set wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap
[nmcli]# save
[nmcli]# activate
```

Congratulations! You have successfully configured WPA2-Enterprise WiFi on your Arch Linux install.
